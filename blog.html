      <h2 class="text-center">Differences between var, let and const keyword</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>JavaScript has three variable declaration statements: var, let and const. The latter two were added in ES6,
        whereas var existed since previous versions. One of the first things to notice is that const defines constants
        (i.e. values that will not be reassigned), whereas var and let define variables. Yet, var behaves differently
        from both let and const in various other ways.</p>
      <h4>var: </h4>
      <p>Before the advent of ES6, var declarations ruled. There are issues associated with variables declared with var,
        though. That is why it was necessary for new ways to declare variables to emerge. First, let's get to understand
        var more before we discuss those issues.</p>
      <h4>let:</h4>
      <p>let is now preferred for variable declaration. It's no surprise as it comes as an improvement to var
        declarations. It also solves the problem with var that we just covered. Let's consider why this is so.</p>
      <h4>const:</h4>
      <p>Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const declarations share some similarities with let
        declarations.</p>

      <h2 class="text-center">What is difference between arrow function and Regular function?</h2>
      <hr>
      <h4>Following are the main differences:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Syntax</li>
        <li>Arguments binding</li>
        <li>Use of this keyword</li>
        <li>Using a new keyword</li>
        <li>No duplicate named parameters</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Syntax:</h4>
      <p>A developer can get the same result as regular functions by writing a few lines of code using arrow functions.

        Curly brackets are not required if only one expression is present.</p>
      <h4>Arguments binding:</h4>
      <p>Arrow functions do not have arguments binding.</p>

      <h4>Use of this keyword:</h4>
      <p>unlike Regular functions, arrow function does not have their own "this" keyword.

        The value of this inside an arrow function remains the same throughout the lifecycle of the function and is
        always bound to the value of this in the closest non-arrow parent function.</p>
      <h4>Using a new keyword:</h4>
      <p>Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and callable. Regular functions are constructible; they can be called using the new keyword.

        However, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e., arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions.</p>
      <h4>No duplicate named parameters:</h4>
      <p>Arrow functions can never have duplicate named parameters, whether in strict or non-strict mode.

        However, We can use duplicate named parameters for regular function in non-strict mode.</p>

      <h1 class="text-center ">diffrence between map(), forEach(), find(), filter()</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>The first difference between map() and forEach() is the returning value. The forEach() method returns undefined
        and map() returns a new array with the transformed elements. Even if they do the same job, the returning value
        remains different.</p>

      <h1 class="text-center ">Why use template string?</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>Template literals provide an easy way to interpolate variables and expressions into strings. The method is called string interpolation.</p>
